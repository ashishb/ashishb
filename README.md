## Blog posts

### Infrastructure

If you are an infrastructure engineer consider my [Docker 101](https://ashishb.net/tech/docker-101-a-basic-web-server-displaying-hello-world/) blog post and then read how you can [deploy web services](https://ashishb.net/tech/how-to-deploy-side-projects-as-web-services-for-free) essentially with zero fixed costs. Afterwards, you might like reading the [pitfalls of Docker's scratch image](https://ashishb.net/all/docker-be-careful-about-the-scratch-image/). You might love or hate me for [questioning](https://ashishb.net/all/some-thoughts-on-low-code/) serverless functions lock-in.

### Go Language

If you use Go language, you would enjoy reading the [most common concurrency pitfall](https://ashishb.net/all/go-language-concurrency-and-an-easy-pitfall/) of the Go language for beginners. Or how to do [inheritance in Go](https://ashishb.net/all/inheritance-in-go-language/). Or writing [Generics in Go](https://ashishb.net/all/generics-in-go/) like Java and C++.

### Devops

1. If you are a devops person, you would enjoy common pitfalls of [GitHub Actions](https://ashishb.net/tech/common-pitfalls-of-github-actions/).
1. If you use bash, consider making it more [robust](https://ashishb.net/all/the-first-two-statements-of-your-bash-script-should-be/), this check would have prevented me from deleting my full disk! I really did that [once](https://ashishb.net/tech/my-rm-rf-moment/).

### Testing

1. Always test code along the [axis of minimum change](https://ashishb.net/all/bad-and-good-ways-to-write-automated-tests/).
1. Test [resumable uploads/downloads](https://ashishb.net/all/testing-resumable-uploads/) - this will save bandwidth and latency for both you and your users
1. Check for missing [network timeouts](https://ashishb.net/all/infinite-network-timeouts-in-java-and-go/) in your network requests

### Android

If you like Android, you would enjoy my critique of [React Native](https://ashishb.net/all/react-native/). A more technical reader would enjoy how to catch [NDK crashes](https://ashishb.net/all/android-catching-ndk-crashes/) and how to catch [crashes on Javascript-to-Java bridge](https://ashishb.net/tech/cross-language-bridge-error-handling-js-to-java-example/). An old but still relevant article on using [Android Fragments](https://ashishb.net/all/android-fragment-related-pitfalls-and-how-to-avoid-them/) without crashing the app. Or how to architect [Android apps from emerging markets](https://ashishb.net/tech/architecting-android-apps-for-emerging-markets/).

If you are an Android user who loves listening to music or podcasts, consider switching to [MusicSync](https://musicsync.ashishb.net/), here's my [reasoning](https://ashishb.net/all/why-i-built-an-alternative-to-google-play-music/) behind building it.
